/* operations ARE NOT statements
ALL OPERATIONS RESULT IN A VALUE!!!
operations really are expressions that result in a value
similar to functions 
they have inputs and return something
operations are internal functions the engine runs


THE LORD OF TRANSFORMATION
THE SURGEON OPERATOR

opens a wormhole (), magical connection to the engine
into the wormhole are sent (inputs) genies, who know how to find the value islands we need for the operation
code runs syncronysly and the entire operation is left with a new genie who points at the specific resulting value

*/


/**
 * if, if/else statments begin with an operation (wormhole) through which the code flows
 * the surgeon operator may not be visible but is there working her magic on an unsuspecting genie's bum
 * the wormhole acts as a gateway, checkpoint, dam control -- directing the flow of the code based on the value returned from the operation
 * 
 * STRANGE WOODEN BOATS FOR TRANSPORTING GENIES --> TO COME!1
 * the value is the result of the statement by the bossy politician shouting e.g. (1 !== false)
 * if the value is true the whole ship catches on fire
 * the value result is always a boolean and will be coerced from any other value-type
 * 
 * if the statement is true the flow is directed to the block {}
 * the block is a special, self contained structure that we (developers) CONSTRUCT which provides a place for our code to run
 * The code may never run if the condition is never met
 * 
 * In if/else if/else code patterns the boat only ever passes through one block
 * If we want to pass it through more than one we can use if/if/if etc.
