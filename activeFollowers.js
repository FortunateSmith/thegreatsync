/*
* This is a more challenging question, covering things we haven't even discussed yet ðŸ˜². It requires you to think about what value the genie points at after each expression. The goal is cognitive effort, not getting the right answer.
* I recommend copying the code into your code editor and isolating the expressions with well-named variables.
* The question: retrieve the number of followers in the "active" category.
